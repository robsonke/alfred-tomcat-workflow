# alfred-tomcat-workflow
Custom workflow to start and stop tomcats in iterm2 windows with Alfred. Based on my local settings but easy to adapt if you want to use it.

Mainly you need to change:
- the paths to tomcat folders
- the predefined list of tomcat environments
- use startup.sh and shutdown.sh instead of my custom scripts

See my short blog post about these scripts for more help: [link](http://www.tigrou.nl/blog/2015/03/01/an-alfred-workflow-to-manage-tomcat-instances-in-iterm2/)
